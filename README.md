### Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I gain experience and understanding in the following areas:

- **React Syntax**: practice writing React code and get familiar with its syntax.

- **Create React App**: learn the process of setting up a React project using Create React App.

- **Using `map` to Access Data**: explore how to use the `map` function to access and render data dynamically.

- **Key Prop**: Understand the significance of using the `key` prop when rendering lists of elements in React.

- **Props Handling**: Gain proficiency in handling props in React components, including receiving props, destructuring props, passing non-string props, and comparing passing objects as props versus spreading objects as props.

This project offers valuable hands-on experience in React development, making it a great resource for anyone looking to improve their React skills.
